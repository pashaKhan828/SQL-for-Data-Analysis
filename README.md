# SQL-for-Data-Analysis
SQL for Data Analysis is a course that I am creating to offer to any Data Science enthusiasts. In this course, I'm teaching it with PostgreSQL. My plan is to start with basic statements like SELECT, FROM, and WHERE. Then, I'm discussing JOINs, derived columns, Window Functions, and CTEs. Date data manipulation functions will also be there. String manipulations and concepts of Primary and Foreign Keys will get their place as well. Advanced topics such as Query Optimizations and Stored Procedures will also be added at the end. The whole course will have intermittent tests/quizzes. From my side, there will be an attempt to use effective datasets to explain topics and real-world applications.
