# SQL-for-Data-Analysis
SQL for Data Analysis is a course that I am creating to offer to any Data Science enthusiasts. In this course, I'm teaching it with PostgreSQL. My plan is to start with basic statements like SELECT, FROM, WHERE. Then, I'm discussing JOINs, derived columns, Window Functions and CTEs. Date data manipulation will also be there.
